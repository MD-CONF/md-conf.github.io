      Following this link <a href="https://tinyurl.com/bdzecfwr">(https://tinyurl.com/bdzecfwr)</a> will bring you to a shared folder with a PDF template for the
      Minidisc labels as well as instructions for making your prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggest using a vector image editor or page layout software for setting up your prints. Inkscape is an open
      source
      and free page layout tool similar to Adobe Illustrator that is available for OSX, Windows and Linux and will also
      run on a Chromebook with the [beta] Linux app extension activated (Thatâ€™s the method I use). I have no association
      with Inkscape and cannot provide support for their software, and it's only a suggestion, feel free to use any
      software with which you are comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your labels will ship Monday and I hope you enjoy your new labels. I know I have enjoyed making them for my discs
      and the final results. I hope that you too will enjoy designing and printing your own labels and that the time I
      have spent making pre-cut labels has made it easier for you. Thanks!
    </p>
